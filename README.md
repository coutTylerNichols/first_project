# TheHungryKnight
CS 304 Github project.
Created by Tyler Nichols on 9/5/20.
This project is meant to calculate how much silver a noble knight owes an Innkeep at the end of their feast. This project makes it quick and easy to calculate medieval silver totals as well as making it easier to charge the King for his knight's greed.

## Inspirations
This project was created in response to an amazing story prompt given by my CS 231 Professor. I've always been interested in the medieval times and this project was very fun and interesting to plan and write. With a combination of an interesting story and simple computations, this project was is an excellent way to get someone into coding.
